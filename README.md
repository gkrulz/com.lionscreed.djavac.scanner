# Project Piranha - A Distributed Java Compiler

Nowadays most of the software companies in the world make products with huge source code. The source code is very complicated and huge usually one million plus LOC. One of the major problems they have is it takes so much of time to compile all that code in one computer or a server machine.
As a solution for this problem the project piranha was introduced.
Project Piranha is a distributed java compiler which can utilize several computers or server machines connected over a network to compile huge pile of java code. Itâ€™s usually faster than a local build.

The proposed system will be equipped with features such as:

1. Being able to setup and configure easily
2. Platform independency
3. Ability to analyze java code and find dependencies
4. Ability to distribute compilation work load among the computers in the distributed system
5. Ability to deliver appropriate dependencies to the appropriate nodes in the distributed system.
6. Ability to compile code in a distributed environment
